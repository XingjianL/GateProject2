this is the OpenCV code I started over the break attempting to better analyze videos. Focus on analyzing gate video in the NCSU pool setting.

image_prep.py - prepare an image and supply methods to modify an image/images

image_process.py - the labelling of images, give image meaning

image_util.py - random utilities for testing

gate_detect.py - should just be a txt file that contain stuff for copy-paste
